# Mluz.db-projects is a combination of my projects that uses my works Database for debt colletion
as well as automation of some boring tasks i have at my job, such as sending messeges to new debtors, and the ones i've got deals with.

Agenda.py:
is a python script that uses my old list of deals in excel, that i've turned into a CSV(acordos.csv) to send automatic messages 
taking in considereation time of day, gender, and more particularities of the deal (like the formando table which is mostly Null)
