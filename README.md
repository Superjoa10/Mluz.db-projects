# *Mluz.db-projects is a combination of my projects that uses my works Database for debt colletion*
as well as automation of some boring tasks i have at my job, such as sending messeges to new debtors, and the ones i've got deals with.

#*Main branch has PyAUTOGUI commands with my personal device in mind.*#

# Python Files:

get_genderr.py:

Is a group of complementory functions that i've created to avoid making the same functions everytime i detect a gender for exemple, or using regex to extract numbers from the DB.

Agenda.py:

is a python script that uses my old list of deals in excel, that i've turned into a CSV(acordos.csv) to send automatic messages taking in considereation time of day, gender, and more particularities of the deal. 

Cobrar_setor.py:
***********Work in progress**************

is a python script that reads my works database that i've translated to excel/CSV becouse of the dificulty of working with a 32 bit access old database, were i use old tables insede the DB to observe and detect particularities in the cases, as well as  getting their phone number and sending a texto to them, as well as the ones that don't have a phone number, just an e-mail, and automating the sending of e-mails as well.
